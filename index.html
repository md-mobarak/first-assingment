            <p class="p">Relying on the human gut is not as easy as it seems. In fact, most people find it difficult to
                listen to the small voice that tries to guide them to make good decisions. Most of us have a laid back
                attitude when it comes to painting a picture about ourselves, especially when it comes to making
                difficult decisions about our relationships, employment, or major decisions in our lives</p>

            <p>At Experience Mission, we think spring break is the perfect time to unplug from academics and commit
                to learning to love and serve others like Jesus.</p>

            <p>In the wake of Covid-19, we've left so many important things behind. It's time to intentionally seek
                out the good and life-changing elements of mission trips we've been missing.</p>

                your hopes.” – Andrew Carnegie. </p>

            <p class=" p">As you prepare to enter a new season of programming, you can lead the program everyone wants
                to be part of. You can lead the program where staff and students flourish. To do it, you start with
                yourself.
